# 🚀 Scan2BIM Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step installation instructions for the Scan2BIM wall detection system.

## 📦 Package Installation

### From Actual Installation Log

The following packages were successfully installed and tested:

```bash
pip install open3d scikit-learn opencv-python scipy numpy
```

**Automatically installed dependencies:**

- `dash`, `nbformat`, `configargparse`, `addict`, `pillow`
- `matplotlib`, `pandas`, `pyyaml`, `tqdm`, `pyquaternion`
- `plotly`, `jupyter-core`, and various other sub-dependencies

## 🐍 Virtual Environment Setup

### If Starting Fresh

**Step 1: Create virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv scan2bim_env
```

**Step 2: Activate environment**

**Linux/Mac:**

```bash
source scan2bim_env/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**

```bash
scan2bim_env\Scripts\activate
```

**Step 3: Install packages**

```bash
pip install open3d scikit-learn opencv-python scipy numpy
```

## ✅ Installation Verification

Run these commands to verify your installation:

```bash
python -c "import open3d as o3d; print('✅ Open3D version:', o3d.__version__)"
python -c "import sklearn; print('✅ scikit-learn installed')"
python -c "import cv2; print('✅ OpenCV installed')"
```

### Expected Output

```
✅ Open3D version: 0.19.0
✅ scikit-learn installed
✅ OpenCV installed
```

## 🎯 Quick Start

Once installation is complete, you can run the wall detection system:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/Scan2BIM

# Run wall detection
python cp_loader.py blk-slam-original.ply
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Error: "No module named 'open3d'"**

```bash
# Ensure you're in the correct environment
conda activate base
# OR
source scan2bim_env/bin/activate

# Reinstall if needed
pip install open3d
```

**Environment Not Found**

```bash
# Check available environments
conda info --envs

# Or use base environment
conda activate base
```

### System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Memory**: 4GB+ RAM recommended for large point clouds
- **Storage**: 2GB+ free space for point cloud files
